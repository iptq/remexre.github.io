Last night, I tried out Jitsi with some friends; my review is:</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yay, Self-Hosting! A friend installed it on a DigitalOcean droplet in ~10 minutes. (Note that he already had a domain to add DNS records to.)</li>
<li>Nicer UI than zoom (subjectively)</li>
<li>Works in browser with no install on PC</li>
<li>Chat and hand-raising are easier to see in the UI</li>
<li>Rooms have names instead of numbers</li>
<li>There's a pretty cool <a href="blur-mode.png">blur mode</a> for privacy, but it reduces the framerate of your video drastically, even on a powerful machine</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seems to require more bandwidth? didn't measure, but a friend on a slower inet connection who doesn't usually have issues with zoom was breaking up on video and audio
<ul>
<li>Mitigation: there's a separate low-bandwidth mode he turned on that made it easier to understand him</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On Android, requires the app; I haven't tried zoom on mobile though, so that might be same</li>
<li>Chat on mobile seems buggy (hard to close the UI, some things were overlapping on my device)</li>
<li>It looks like the only permissions are &quot;is this client allowed by the server&quot; rather than &quot;is this user allowed to join this room&quot;
<ul>
<li>Somewhat mitigated by it autogenerating high-entropy names for rooms, e.g. GrossBasketsSuspendSeriously</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By default, there's a watermark for guest users; this is allegedly easy to disable in the config, though.</li>
<li>Screensharing is relatively laggy; it's fine for slides or coding, but it made streaming games to each other difficult</li>
<li>No push-to-talk. Zoom doesn't support this on Linux either, but still a con.</li>
<li>No virtual backgrounds. A lot of people are asking for it though, and I conjecture that the code for blur mode could probably be extended without too much pain to provide this; hopefully it'll be coming soon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mixed Pro/Con:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's a concept of &quot;the current speaker,&quot; and everyone else has their mic quieter; this is nice when some people have slightly noisy backgrounds, but it makes it hard to interrupt someone</li>
<li>Instead of meetings you invite people to that start at a given time, there's rooms anyone with the link can join at any time; though as far as I can tell, you can configure either one to act like the other</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, Jitsi seems better for the case of &quot;some friends chatting,&quot; and probably for smaller meetings.</p>
