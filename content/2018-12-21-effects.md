# Monads

In a purely functional language like haskell, you can embed effects using monads.

so a monad can be thought of as "a strategy to produce a value"

where how the strategy works depends on the monad

so an error monad, e.g. ErrorT e (from that example), is "a strategy to produce a value where errors might occur"

so (ErrorT ParseIntError Int) is the type of strategies to produce Ints where ParseIntErrors might happen

(StateT World String) is the type of strategies to produce Strings that have a World value as readable+writable state

er, switch that to (Error e), (Error ParseIntError Int), (State World String), etc

the T's come in later

there are also more exotic effects, e.g. one could write a Nondet monad, where (Nondet Path) is the type of strategies to produce a Path where nondeterminism exists

and Identity is the trivial monad, i.e. there is no effect

there's two ways to define monads, return+bind and join

er, I think you need return with join too if you don't have applicative functors (which I'm ignoring here)

most languages do bind, so I'm ignoring join for now

for any monad m,

return has type (a -> m a)
bind has type ((a -> m b) -> m a -> m b)

in English, if you have a value x, (return x) is a strategy to produce that value for whatever monad you're talking about

e.g. (return 5) is a (State World Int) that doesn't do anything to the state, an (Error ParseIntError Int) that doesn't have an error, etc

and bind is best read and-then

er wait, screwed up the order of args to bind

(m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b) is the right order

so if I have a strategy to produce a value x of type a, and a function f that takes values of type a and produces strategies to produce values of type b, then you can get a strategy to produce values of type b
