Imagine walking into a restaurant and ordering a roast duck.
After waiting half an hour, you're surprised to receive not duck, but a peacock.
That describes my feelings for this class.

This week's lecture was about "Genetic Engineering and Monstrous Babies," which essentially ended up being about eugenics and its portrayal in fiction, as well as its current and potential future role in society.
I complained about how there was less than a minute of video before she used the phrase "white male cisgender heteronormativity," without a huge reason for the usage of the phrase.
The context of the usage is:

> For instance, where is the line between a serious health condition and cultural preferences for dominant ideas about normality, health, and disease?
> We have to remember that most deviations from white male cisgender heteronormativity have, at one time or another, been considered diseases that scientists have sought to cure.
> For an example, one need think no further than the mythical gay gene or historically, to the eugenics movement of the first half of the 20th century, which was bound up in the idea of a master Aryan race.

The phrase "white male cisgender heteronormativity" certainly *can* have a meaning, but is used here as uselessly as the gaudy feathers of a peacock.
Clearly, no proponent of eugenics would make an honest attempt to select for maleness genetically; the concept makes essentially no sense, as should hopefully be obvious.
Attempts at eugenics to "preserve whiteness" certainly have existed, as have those to attempt to eliminate LGBT people.
So why include maleness into the list of characteristics?

There's a concept called [signalling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_(economics)) in economics.
Succinctly, in a transaction between two people, there is certain information the "seller" cannot manipulate (indices) and some the seller can (signals).
A common example (stolen straight from Wikipedia!) is the role of a college degree for a job that does not require the *knowledge* from a college education.
However, having a degree (and a high GPA, etc.) signals to a potential employer that one is capable of working intelligently, acting as a sort of background check that the employee chooses to provide.
An employer then can use the degree as a way to determine the otherwise-hard-to-evaluate work ethic of the potential employee.

Consider academic publication as an economic transaction between an academic who is "selling" the concept in the paper, and the publisher, who is being "bartered with."
The core content of the paper (i.e. the thesis) is definitely an index, but the actual verbiage used is largely signalling.
So what signal would using the phrase "white male cisgender heteronormativity" be intended to send?
Chip Morningstar remarks that "...the quality of academic work, particularly in the humanities, is judged primarily on the basis of politics and cleverness."
While I believe this is a bit harsh (as someone currently working in academia), the signal that is sent by sprinkling in this precomposed phrase is essentially "conformity to the New Left."
With this in mind, the use of other uncommon words being used in an almost *shibboleth*-like fashion (e.g. "authoritarian culture", "hegemonic") makes more sense.

TODO The other mention of "heteronormativity" and its signals

The lecture as a whole could essentially be summarized as:

 - We're not a post-racial society, and we should strongly consider whether it's a good idea to legalize technology that could be used for eugenics until that changes
 - While in the 1900s eugenics was advertised as something you support being done *to someone else* for the good of society, in its current incarnation it's something you do *to yourself* to give your children (the potential for a better life)
 - Yet again, pure market capitalism results in negative externalities

Surrounding these three points is an enormous amount of... words.
"Evidence" would be the term I'd like to use, but predictions about the future from the 1950s aren't really *evidence*.

TODO The Part Where I Talk About Why I Ordered Duck

> Since the nuclear family is concerned with the quality of reproduction (and quality in this case is dictated by capitalist demand), giving one's child a genetic edge will simply become another way of ensuring that parents can provide their children with these advantages, and their children in turn will give society their best economic performance.
> In this thoroughly rationalized situation, quality of life is equated with economic performance, and eugenic participation is reinscribed as a sign of benevolence.

And if you think I'm picking and choosing arbitrarily to make my point, remember that this is the class that claimed *Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde* was an allegory about homosexuality, with essentially no evidence beyond reasoning that the evil thing that Hyde was doing was probably homosexuality. Rather than, y'know, the murders.
So maybe I am picking the bits that fit my point, but I'm not the only one.

Also, this is totally both close reading and [deconstruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deconstruction).
And both of those are apparently virtuous by the standards of the class and the field.
