Only 11 months less a day between posts, this time!

I'm restarting the blog, again. All the old content is still on GitHub, on [the `authoring-old-2019-01-14` branch](https://github.com/remexre/remexre.github.io/tree/authoring-old-2019-01-14). The real reason is that upstream changes to Zola broke a template I wasn't really using anyway, and I've been putting off fixing it.

I actually have a few things to blog about planned out, this time. Expect:

-	A project to allow more ergonomic FFI between Rust and Lisp/Python
-	Notes about a simple graph database from scratch in Rust
-	Guides on setting up machines the way I do

Hopefully, I'll finish at least one post a month this time...
