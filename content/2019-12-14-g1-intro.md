Intro
-----

-	SQLite good b/c ez to configure
-	Wanted a graph db for a project, with Datalog for querying
-	Making simple graph database seems like a good project to blog abt, to incentivize myself to learn abt how to do this well

Model
-----

**Atom**: Atoms are the nodes of the graph. Each is represented as a UUID.

**Name**: Names uniquely identify an Atom. They have a namespace and a title, both of which are Strings.

**Edge**: Edges are directed, with an Atom at both endpoints. Edges have a String label associated with them. At most one edge between two Atoms with a given label may exist.

**Tag**: Tags are attached to Atoms. They have a key and a value, both of which are Strings.

**Blob**: Blobs are attached to Atoms. They have a kind, which is a String; a type, which is a MIME type; and contents, which are an arbitrarily large binary String. Blobs are referred to by a SHA256 hash.

Strings are UTF-8 Strings, which should be no longer than 256 bytes.

Query Language
--------------

[Datalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog) variant

Builtin predicates for reading data in the database (IDB):

-	`atom(Atom)`
-	`name(Atom, Namespace, Title)`
-	`edge(From, To, Label)`
-	`tag(Atom, Key, Value)`
-	`blob(Atom, Kind, Mime, Hash)`

```prolog
f(X, y).
```
