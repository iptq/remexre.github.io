I'm planning to work on an IR for [Silver](https://github.com/melt-umn/silver), an attribute-grammar based language for compiler construction.
This'll probably form the core of my MS thesis work, so my advisor recommended I blog about it as a way to communicate everything properly to the rest of the group, with the side benefits of getting a head start on laying everything out for writing the actual thesis.
