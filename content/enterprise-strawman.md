A friend ([Michael Zhang](https://iptq.io/)) and I may be working on a web framework for Rust, [`enterprise`](https://crates.io/crates/enterprise). This post serves as a strawman proposal for this framework, and as documentation for what the framework may eventually be.

Also note that despite the authorial "we," this is almost entirely my vision (hence the S-expressions, use of Prolog, etc.), so expect this to be a strawman that's lit aflame rather than fortified.

Introduction
============

The model we use for webapps is described by the diagrams:

```dot
digraph "dependency graph" {
	graph[bgcolor="#1e1f29"];

	BLogic[color="#8be9fe" fontcolor="#8be9fe" label="Business\nLogic"];
	Actions[color="#8be9fe" fontcolor="#8be9fe"];
	Schema[color="#8be9fe" fontcolor="#8be9fe"];
	Views[color="#fc4cb4" fontcolor="#fc4cb4"];
	ViewAdapters[color="#f0fb8c" fontcolor="#f0fb8c" label="View\nAdapters"];

	Authentication[color="#f0fb8c" fontcolor="#f0fb8c"];
	Authorization[color="#fc4cb4" fontcolor="#fc4cb4"];

	Actions -> Schema [color="#fc4346"];
	Authorization -> Actions [color="#fc4346"];
	Authorization -> Authentication [color="#fc4346"];
	Authorization -> Schema [color="#fc4346"];
	BLogic -> Actions [color="#fc4346"];
	BLogic -> Authentication [color="#fc4346"];
	BLogic -> Schema [color="#fc4346"];
	Views -> Authentication [color="#fc4346"];
	Views -> Schema [color="#fc4346"];
	Views -> ViewAdapters [color="#fc4346"];
}
```

```dot
digraph "dataflow graph" {
	graph[bgcolor="#1e1f29"];

	HTTP[color="#cfcfcf" fontcolor="#cfcfcf" pos="0,0!" shape=plaintext];
	Databases[color="#cfcfcf" fontcolor="#cfcfcf" shape=plaintext];

	Authorization[color="#fc4cb4" fontcolor="#fc4cb4"];
	Actions[color="#8be9fe" fontcolor="#8be9fe"];
	BLogic[color="#8be9fe" fontcolor="#8be9fe" label="Business\nLogic"];
	DAL[color="#f0fb8c" fontcolor="#f0fb8c"];
	Router[color="#f0fb8c" fontcolor="#f0fb8c" pos="100,0!"];
	ViewAdapters[color="#f0fb8c" fontcolor="#f0fb8c" label="View\nAdapters"];
	Views[color="#fc4cb4" fontcolor="#fc4cb4"];

	Authentication[color="#f0fb8c" fontcolor="#f0fb8c"];

	{rank=same; Authentication, ViewAdapters};
	{rank=same; BLogic, Views};
	{rank=same; Actions, Authorization};

	HTTP -> Router -> HTTP [color="#cfcfcf"];
	Databases -> DAL -> Databases [color="#cfcfcf"];

	// When the router gets a request, it passes it to the business logic,
	// along with the results of authentication.
	Router -> BLogic [color="#50fb7c"];
	Router -> Authentication -> BLogic [color="#50fb7c"];

	// The business logic performs actions (and gets data from them).
	BLogic -> Actions -> BLogic [color="#50fb7c"];

	// Actions are allowed or disallowed based on the results of
	// authorization, which is also informed by authentication and the
	// database (via the DAL).
	Authentication -> Authorization [color="#50fb7c"];
	Authorization -> Actions [color="#50fb7c"];
	DAL -> Authorization [color="#50fb7c"];

	// Actions communicate with the database via the DAL.
	Actions -> DAL -> Actions [color="#50fb7c"];

	// The business logic then communicates the response to views, which
	// are rendered with view adapters, which then send a rendered response
	// to the router.
	BLogic -> Views -> ViewAdapters -> Router [color="#50fb7c"];
}
```

Auth
----

The generic phrase "auth" confusingly can refer to either "authentication" or "authorization." These are conflated both by the term and in many people's heads, so we avoid it, and make a strong split between the two.

### Authentiation

Authentication is the answer to the question "what user does this request correspond to?" As with other parts of a web application, `enterprise` simplifies authentication by abstracting it heavily.

For our app, we want to allow a plethora of authentication methods, while also allowing a user to have multiple authentication methods. (This is useful since a user might forget whether they registered with their Google account or email, and it allows an anonymous user to add an email and stop being anonymous!)

In `app.sexp`:

```
(authentication
  (multiple true)
  (providers
    anonymous-cookie
    (email-password :reset email)
    oauth-facebook
    oauth-google
    oauth-twitter))
```

In **views/login.sexp**:

```
TODO
```

### Authorization

Authorization is the answer to the question "can this user perform this action?" This is almost entirely application-specific, so we leave the logic here to the app author.

But wait, we're using logic on a question with a boolean answer? Well, I know the best way to do this! `enterprise` apps specify authorization information with a Prolog dialect.

For our app, TODO.

In `src/authorization.pro`:

```pro
authorized(UserID, Action). # TODO
```
